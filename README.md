# When Q-learning meets Hadoop
---
This is a course project on Cloud Computation. I am using Hadoop to implement (part of) Q-learning, which, more specifically, is the part where Q-value is updated.

Some rudimental information about Q-Learning can be found in here:

Runing the code

- Set up Hadoop, Python
- Make sure /user/username/ is in hdfs
- cd workplace
- ./run.sh
